      <p>
        Thank you for contacting Plusnet today.<br /><br />

        As discussed, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a recognised measure of
        inflation that tracks the average increase in prices for consumers and
        businesses across the country over the last 12 months.<br /><br />

        All accounts in scope will have an increase applied after 31st March
        2024 based on the December CPI rate of 4.00% + 3.90%, resulting in a
        total increase of 7.9% as announced by the Office for National
        Statistics.<br /><br />

        I'm sorry to hear that you are not happy with the recent price rise.<br /><br />

        Unfortunately, this is due to company policy, and I am unable to prevent
        this from happening.<br /><br />

        Thank you for your understanding!<br /><br />

        <b>CPI Figure:</b><br /><br />
