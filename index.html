          I advised the customer to manually remove the restriction by selecting 'Click here to acknowledge and continue' or 'Click on remove restriction temporarily' to bypass the splash screen. However, they were unable to complete the process.<br /><br />
      
          Can we please remove the splash screen restriction as the customer is unable to bypass the splash screen?<br /><br />
